					<p>I have been recording my week's worth of trash for a full year now and wanted to celebrate the occasion by looking back to the start of this website. Although I was previously aware of the fact that everyone disposes of too much waste for this planet's good, I felt as though I was not part of the problem. To me, the landfills did not feel like my responsibility, since waste accumulation was a collective effort of billions rather than a direct consequence of my personal habits.</p>
					<p>The event that finally changed my point of view was COVID-19 when I heard about turtles choking on the ear loops of disposable face masks. Something about this particular news woke me up, having me regret how I neglected to care for my methods of disposal. As everyone knows by now, the solution to the turtles choking on masks is a simple one - you just have to cut the loops before discarding the mask. The simple solution influenced me, giving me the motivation and courage to believe that small changes could help our natural habitat. It motivated to believe that small adjustments in individual behavior could contribute to broader environmental change. A few years after the lockdown - exactly 52 weeks ago - I decided to make the Waste Web to publicly record how I deal with waste, in hopes to look back and improve my way of living, as well as potentially inspiring others to rethink their own habits. </p>

					<p>I've explored different perspectives on waste throughout the year and found Brian Thill's work to be the most eye-opening. He describes waste as an abandoned object that is neither useful nor completely gone. His idea of waste as “indifference” really put things into perspective, as I used to think my garbage disappeared once I threw it away. In reality, it sticks around - making up landfills, flowing in oceans, piling up in spaces we no longer think about.</p>
					<p><a href="https://anthropology.uchicago.edu/directory/Sarah-Newman" target="_blank">Sarah Newman</a>'s <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/U/bo197202045.html" target="_blank">Unmaking Waste: New Histories of Old Things</a> offers another intriguing perspective. She argues that the idea of “waste” did not exist in ancient civilizations, and that it is a concept of the modern times. Ancient civilizations like the Aztecs had advanced waste management systems that focused on reusing in ways that are better than the systems in place today, further influencing the way I think about my own waste. As I kept track of my weekly trash, I was able to notice patterns in how I consume and discard things. Much of what I once saw as unavoidable garbage could have been reduced, reused, or skipped altogether.</p>
					<p>I was notably inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vik_Muniz" target="_blank">Vik Muniz</a>, an artist known for transforming discarded materials into art that can start new conversations. His work at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jardim_Gramacho" target="_blank">Jardim Gramacho</a>, one of the world's largest landfills, made me think about waste as a record of human behavior. Trash is a reflection of what we once valued, not merely what we no longer need. Looking the records of my waste by the week, the food cravings and moments where convenience and laziness outweighed the rest are easily noticeable. Waste is more than an environmental issue - it's revealing and deeply tied to our behaviors. It's also very admirable on my end, because this is all I can do in terms of turning my trash into art:</p>

					<p>Scientific research also plays a major role in understanding waste. Studies in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology" target="_blank">ecology</a> emphasize the long-term effects of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/plastic-pollution">plastic pollution</a>, while new discoveries explore solutions, like bacteria that can break down certain plastics (Richon, Kvale, & Lebreton, 2023; Wilkes et al., 2024). Research into circular economies challenges the idea that waste is inevitable (Romero-Hernández & Romero, 2018). Instead, it's a design flawone that better materials and policies, along with individual choices can fix. As I continue my journey of documenting waste, I want to integrate more science-based strategies to reduce my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_footprint" target="_blank">ecological footprint</a>. </p>
					<p>Viewing waste through an archaeological lens adds another layer to the conversation. Archaeologists study discarded items to understand past civilizations. As Newman points out in her <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/archaeologist-talks-trash" target="_blank">interview on UChicago News</a>, our trash today will tell future historians about our culture, economy, and values. This perspective has changed how I view my own waste, making me near self conscious about my trash. Like Muniz's art, the archaeological lens reinforced the idea that very item we throw away says something about our habits, offering insight of what we we no longer value. The archaeological viewpoint suggests that evaluating trash serves as a historical record of how we interact with material goods.</p>
					<p>Lastly, online projects tackling waste have also influenced me. Programs like <a href="https://www.litterati.org/" target="_blank">Litterati</a> use digital tools to map and track litter, offering a visual of how collective efforts can work up to meaningful change. Participating in these efforts has promoted a sense of community and emphasized how collective small actions can make a difference. Waste Web is not only about my personal waste anymore - it's about contributing to a bigger movement in reevaluating our relationship with waste.</p>
					<p>Looking back on the year I spent with Waste Web, I see how my perspective on waste and the environment has changed. My simple online journal has grown into an exploration of waste as an environmental, cultural, and personal issue. To me, Waste Web has flourished into a journey filled with awareness, learning, and a sense of responsibility. Waste isn't just a byproduct of modern life; it's a reflection of how we live. By continuing this blog, I hope to proceed in analyzing and improving my own habits, engage in meaningful discussions (with you guys!), and (hopefully) inspire others. Moving forward, I want to bring in diverse perspectives from different spheres, especially from science, history, and art. By looking at waste from multiple angles, we can start creating tangible solutions for waste in the environment.</p>
