		<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
			<p>I have been recording my week's worth of trash for a full year now, and wanted to celebrate the occasion by looking back to the start of this website. Although I was previously aware of the fact everyone disposes of too much waste for this planet's good, I felt as though I was not part of the problem. To me, the landfills did not feel like my responsibility, since it was a collective effort of the billions of people on this Earth rather than a problem that I directly and constantly contributed to. The event that finally changed my point of view was actually COVID-19, when I heard something along the lines of turtles choking on the ear loops of disposable face masks. Something about this particular news woke me up, having me regret how I neglected to care for my methods of disposal. As everyone knows by now, the solution to the turtles choking on masks is a simple one - you just have to cut the loops before discarding the mask. The simple solution influenced me, giving me the motivation and courage to believe that small changes could help our natural habitat. A few years after the lockdown - exactly 52 weeks ago - I decided to make the Waste Web to publicly record how I deal with waste, in hopes to look back and improve my way of living.</p>

		<h2 id="ww">Weekly Waste</h2>
			<p>This week I was surprised to see no food waste, but that just implies that I spent a lot of time eating out with people (a tragic week for my wallet, really). On the bright side, it means that I potentially saved a lot of plastic, so I think I will focus on that instead of my expansive spending habits as a temporarily unemployed college student. This was my second week back on campus and the beginning of my last semester in this dorm, so I figured it would be beneficial to start getting rid of things around the dorm before the semester gets too hectic. I spent the week looking for things to dispose of, and there were quite a few items that could use a new home - which could either be my dorm-issued trash can or in the hands of my friends. Interestingly enough, I am regretfully discarding the items included in week's waste unlike usual, but as I mentioned earlier this year, one of my New Year's resolutions was to stop hoarding and to get rid of things that no longer fulfills its purpose, so I figured I should stay true to that.</p>

			<h3>Sponsored Items</h3>
				<p>Just as I have for the past 52 weeks, I divided the weekly waste into a few categories. The first category is sponsored items. This category includes a broken velvet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothes_hanger" target="_blank">hanger</a>, a broken <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw_clip" target="_blank">claw clip</a>, and a misshapen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_roller" target="_blank">hair roller</a>. The commonality, believe it or not, is that these items were obtained from my parents, hence the categorization. The velvet hanger is teal in color and triangular in shape, making it the most colorful (and most angled) item in my closet. In case anyone was not aware, a clothes hanger is used to hang items of clothing in the closet. It really is an immaculate investment for organizing a closet if you have yet to try them. One of my clothes hangers broke while I was - you guessed it - hanging clothes. Its velvety texture offered the right amount of friction to keep my hoodies and jackets off the ground, which I duly appreciated. Despite its immense utility, its death was not mourned because many of its clones still prevail in my university-issued closet. As I mentioned earlier, the method of acquisition for this hanger was pretty typical for a college student, meaning that I stole it and its clones from my parents' closet while packing my belongings to bring to the dorms. The hanger is quite flexible, but I pushed its limits by putting too must trust in its abilities, causing its quick and easy downfall. This would have been my fifth semester with this hanger, so I hate to see it go, however, staying true to my resolutions, I discarded the broken hanger. </p>
				<p>The second item in this category is my favorite claw clip, which was perfect in size and grip. A screw connecting the two claws unfortunately escaped the hinge awhile back, but I just kept its corpse with my other hair accessories in sorrow. I kept it in hopes to be able to fix the claw clip to no avail as it seemed to have missing parts despite the fact that I still have the screw with me. I originally had "borrowed" this claw clip from my mother, which makes its disconformity all the more unfortunate, as I have no idea where I can repurchase this specific claw clip. I personally do not prefer putting my hair up, however, I often use claw clips to keep my short front pieces of hair out of my face while lounging in my room. I really liked the how this claw clip looked, as it was black and sleek and more rectangular than other claw clips, which came to me as unique. I do miss having a working claw clip however, so I decided to finally get rid of it and either buy or borrow a new claw clip. The third and last item in the sponsored item category is a blue hair roller. It was a nice hair roller for my bangs that was 4.4 cm in diameter. What makes these hair rollers useful is its shape, as it is used to give hair volume with its round shape. The problem with this hair roller was that as I moved into my current dorm, it was stepped on by my roommate, making the circle base of the cylinder almond shaped, rendering it useless. It was there for me through all of my impulsive dorm hair cutting, letting my unprofessional fringe look somewhat acceptable to walk around in. </p>


			<h3>Event Winnings</h3>
				<p>The second category of waste is event winnings. The first item of this category is the pair of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses" target="_blank">sunglasses</a> I obtained from the Rutgers hackathon event called HackRU last October, which was given to me as a gift for answering a few questions about a sponsoring company correctly. Although it is a small win I enjoy commemorating, I have been feeling as though the sunglasses were a waste of dorm space, as I had not worn it a single time. The fact that the lenses just completely double as a mirror intimidated me and deterred me from wearing them. I gave it away to a friend that wanted it instead of throwing it out, as I figured that it would be better to give it to someone rather than discarding a perfectly new item. The second item in this category is my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Nest_(smart_speakers)#Home_Mini" target="_blank">Google Home Mini</a>, which I got from an event from Spotify in 2019, where all users with Spotify Premium could receive this smart speaker as long as they knew about it and signed up for it. After five full years of owning this speaker, I figured it is finally time to get rid of it as I can count the number times I used it on one hand.  I would occasionally ask Google for the time or weather, but other than that, I had not utilized its abilities to its full potential. I asked around to see if anyone wanted to keep the speaker, but no one did, so I sold the device online for five dollars since I did get it for free and it is quite old for a smart speaker. The last item in this category is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart" target="_blank" >Walmart</a> branded SPF <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_balm" target="_blank">lip balm</a> I received in front of the College Avenue Student center. There were people tabling with a wheel to spin, and I won the lip balm. It was the gift I wanted, which I was excited about, until it completely left my mind. I rediscovered it while scrounging my dorm for things I could get rid of and realized it unfortunately expired last December, when otherwise I would have used it to survive this dry winter season.</p>

			<h3>Purchased Items</h3>
				<p>The last category for this week is things I actually spent money on. This category includes a container of expired <a href="https://a.co/d/5q6cLJ6" target="_blank">vitamin D supplements</a>, the head of a <a href="https://rhshawkeye.com/10120/lifestyle/the-global-uprise-of-smiskis-is-it-worth-the-hype/" target="_blank">Smiski</a> figurine, and a single slat of a set of vertical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_blind" target="_blank">blinds</a>. I am not the biggest fan of outdoor activities, which had me concerned for a potential vitamin D deficiency and make a panic purchase of supplements one-point-five years ago. The bottle is almost filled to the brim because as a serial forgetter, I almost never remembered to take them. I feel like this is excusable though, as it turns out that I have been confirmed to not have a vitamin D deficiency, and it is probably worse to take supplements that are expired than to finish the bottle while ignoring the expiration date. This may have been a minor financial mistake however, as it was almost $20, which is more than an hour of minimum-wage labor. Second in line for this category is the head of a Smiski figurine. I lost its body during the move-in process this semester, which absolutely breaks my heart. I wanted to keep the head as a memorial, but it would just serve as a reminder for my wrongdoings (losing its literal body), so I gave it to a friend that showed interest to it. This item was $12 and was bought in the K-Pop store in the H Mart in Edison (township in New Jersey). I am considering buying a replacement as I do miss having a green little guy on my desk, but I will give it more time as this loss deeply affected me. The last item I have in this category was a single vertical blind, from my roommate's room. The reason I put the slat in this category is because it came with the dorm, and I am paying to live in this form, therefore I also paid for this slat. I found this in the pantry of our dorm, as it was broken by my dorm's previous resident, and figured I could throw it out as it is, in fact, broken. My reasoning for this was: what is the university going to do with a single broken slat? So I took the picture for this week's blog and threw it out. I am convinced that the blinds are decades old, but since I have been in this dorm for five months, I guess it would not be wrong to say that I have owned it for five months. </p>

		<h2 id="iotw">Item of the Week</h2>
			<p>The item of the week for the 53rd week of the Waste Web is … the Smiski head! It made the most sense as it was the item I felt the strongest for. This was probably the hardest useless hoarding item I had to get rid of, and I miss it every day. I wish I took more pictures of it while it still had its limbs, but I guess there is nothing I can do about it now… This Smiski head kept me through the ups and downs of the past few semesters, lighting up my world - literally, it absorbs light and glows in the dark - during dark times. I really liked its dynamic pose (it was stretching) and stoic face despite its marked up price in local stores. I am shameful to admit that I was not aware of its tragic physical state until recently as I was busy with the beginning of a new semester, but I hope it enjoys its time in its new home and enjoys its time there. The Smiski figurines are <a href="https://thesciencesurvey.com/arts-entertainment/2024/05/10/smiski-hidden-during-day-glowing-during-night/" target="_blank">inspired by creatures of Japanese folklore</a> (potentially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Dkai" target="_blank">yokai</a>, which are spirits from a mystical realm and were traditionally believed to be responsible for supernatural phenomena) and they are depicted to be curious creatures that like to hide around in small corners. First released in 2009, the glow-in-the-dark feature was loved by the public, and along with the growing popularity in blind box figurines, the Smiski figurines soon became a global hit. With different themes along different series, it intends to have buyers purchase enough boxes of that series to collect all of the different figurines in that set. There are debates as to when blind boxes first emerged, as some say that they appeared during the Edo period (1603 to 1867), while some say that they first appeared in the late Meiji period (approximately 1912), others claiming its first emergence to be in the 90s. The Smiski figurines are produced by Dreams Inc. (while its manufacturing location is unknown), and is made of the phosphorescent ATBC-PVC according to its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smiski-Dreams-Figure-Museum-Random/dp/B08Z8FNMFJ#:~:text=Smiski%20Pearl%20Earring.-,Made%20from%20ATBC%2DPVC,for%20anyone%20needing%20a%20smile!" target="_blank">Amazon description</a>, and are still actively in production. Dreams Inc. is also famous for their 2005 blind box figurine release, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Angel" target="_blank">Sonny Angels</a>. </p>
